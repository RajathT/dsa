Arrays vs Linked List
Arrays - 
Advantages - Lookup O(1). This is possible by calculating the size of the object first, then multiplying the index and adding it to the base address of the array. This lookup is done in constant time.
Disadvantage: Fixed Size. Costly position based insertions - If an element needs to be inserted at the beginning of an array, then the array needs to be shifted.

Linked List -
Advantages - Size dynamically adjusted
Disadvantages - Lookup - O(N), because they are not contiguous blocks of memory
